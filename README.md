# Chess

An implementation of Chess in Rust.

# Diatribe

Chess is a powerful learning tool.
When the game is presented to a programmer
it makes a great way to learn a new language,
new concepts, and even sometimes critical thinking.

I hope that this reflects all three.

# Installation

This version of Chess is intended to be a library first.
That being said, it comes with a reference implementation
that gives a playable game board.

Clone the repository, then use cargo to run the game:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ryanhiebert/rust-chess.git
cd rust-chess
cargo run
```
